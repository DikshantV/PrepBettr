# Token Abuse & Session Risks Assessment

## Executive Summary

This document models five critical attack scenarios related to token abuse and session security risks. Each scenario represents a different attack vector that could compromise application security and user data.

## Attack Scenario Analysis

### 1. Replay of Stolen Cookie

**Attack Vector**: Unauthorized reuse of legitimate session tokens
**Risk Level**: HIGH

#### Attack Description
- Attacker intercepts or steals valid session cookies through various means:
  - Man-in-the-middle attacks on unsecured connections
  - Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities
  - Browser vulnerabilities or malware
  - Physical access to unattended devices
- Stolen cookies are replayed to impersonate the legitimate user

#### Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: CRITICAL - Full access to user data and functionality
- **Integrity**: HIGH - Ability to modify user data and perform actions
- **Availability**: MEDIUM - Potential for account lockout or service disruption

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Use HttpOnly and Secure cookie flags
- Implement cookie expiration and rotation
- Add IP address validation (with caution for mobile users)
- Implement device fingerprinting
- Use additional authentication factors for sensitive operations

### 2. Session Fixation via Deterministic Cookie Name

**Attack Vector**: Predictable session identifiers enabling session hijacking
**Risk Level**: HIGH

#### Attack Description
- Application uses predictable or deterministic session cookie names/values
- Attacker can predict or force specific session identifiers
- User is tricked into using a session ID controlled by the attacker
- Once user authenticates, attacker gains access using the known session ID

#### Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: CRITICAL - Complete session takeover
- **Integrity**: CRITICAL - Full control over user session
- **Availability**: MEDIUM - Potential for denial of service

#### Attack Flow
1. Attacker identifies predictable session ID pattern
2. Attacker pre-sets session ID (via URL parameter or cookie injection)
3. User authenticates while using attacker-controlled session ID
4. Attacker uses known session ID to access authenticated session

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Generate cryptographically secure random session IDs
- Regenerate session ID upon authentication (session ID rotation)
- Validate session ID format and entropy
- Implement session binding to client characteristics
- Use secure session storage mechanisms

### 3. Inability to Revoke Sessions

**Attack Vector**: Persistent unauthorized access due to lack of session management
**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH

#### Attack Description
- Application lacks proper session revocation mechanisms
- Compromised sessions cannot be terminated remotely
- Sessions persist indefinitely without proper cleanup
- Users cannot terminate their own sessions from other devices

#### Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: HIGH - Extended unauthorized access
- **Integrity**: HIGH - Continued ability to modify data
- **Availability**: LOW - Limited impact on service availability

#### Scenarios
- Employee termination with active sessions
- Device theft or loss with persistent sessions
- Suspected account compromise without revocation capability
- Shared device usage without logout capability

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement centralized session management
- Provide user-facing session management interface
- Implement administrative session revocation
- Set reasonable session timeouts
- Implement concurrent session limits
- Store session state server-side for immediate revocation

### 4. Privilege Escalation via Tampered Payload (Weak Decoder)

**Attack Vector**: Token manipulation exploiting weak validation
**Risk Level**: CRITICAL

#### Attack Description
- Application uses weak or improper token validation
- Attacker modifies token payload to escalate privileges
- Insufficient signature verification or encryption
- Client-side tokens trusted without server-side validation

#### Common Vulnerabilities
- JWT tokens with "alg": "none" accepted
- Insufficient signature verification
- Weak signing keys or algorithms
- Client-side role/permission storage
- Lack of token integrity checks

#### Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: CRITICAL - Access to privileged data
- **Integrity**: CRITICAL - Administrative actions possible
- **Availability**: HIGH - System-wide compromise possible

#### Attack Examples
- Modifying JWT payload to change user role from "user" to "admin"
- Altering permission claims in access tokens
- Bypassing signature verification through algorithm confusion
- Exploiting weak encoding/decoding implementations

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Use strong cryptographic signatures (RS256, ES256)
- Implement robust token validation on server-side
- Never trust client-side authorization data
- Use short-lived tokens with refresh mechanisms
- Implement proper key management practices
- Validate all token claims server-side

### 5. ID-Token Phishing Leading to Lateral Movement

**Attack Vector**: Social engineering to steal identity tokens for broader access
**Risk Level**: HIGH

#### Attack Description
- Attacker tricks users into revealing ID tokens through phishing
- Stolen tokens used to access multiple connected services
- Single sign-on (SSO) systems amplify the attack impact
- Lateral movement across interconnected systems

#### Attack Flow
1. Phishing campaign targeting ID token credentials
2. User submits credentials to malicious site
3. Attacker captures ID tokens or session information
4. Tokens used to access primary application
5. Lateral movement to connected services and applications
6. Privilege escalation within interconnected systems

#### Impact Assessment
- **Confidentiality**: CRITICAL - Multi-system data exposure
- **Integrity**: CRITICAL - Cross-platform data manipulation
- **Availability**: HIGH - Multiple system compromise

#### Lateral Movement Vectors
- SSO token reuse across multiple applications
- API access tokens with broad scope
- Service-to-service authentication compromise
- Cloud service integration exploitation

#### Mitigation Strategies
- Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Use phishing-resistant authentication methods
- Implement token binding and audience restrictions
- Monitor for suspicious cross-service access patterns
- Implement zero-trust network architecture
- Regular security awareness training
- Implement anomaly detection for unusual access patterns
