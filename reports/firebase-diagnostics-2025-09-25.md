# Firebase Admin SDK 401 Error Diagnostics Report

**Date:** September 25, 2025  
**Environment:** Azure App Service Production  
**Issue:** 401 authentication errors in `/api/auth/signin` and `/api/auth/signup` endpoints

## Executive Summary

Our Phase 1 diagnostics have identified that **Firebase Admin SDK configuration is working correctly in development** but failing in production on Azure App Service. The issue appears to be environment-specific, likely related to environment variable configuration or Azure Key Vault access.

## Diagnostic Tools Implemented

### ‚úÖ Completed Phase 1 Diagnostics

1. **Comprehensive Logging System**
   - Firebase Admin SDK initialization with detailed error reporting
   - Authentication flow tracing in signin/signup endpoints
   - Unified auth system logging with token verification details
   - Azure Key Vault fallback logging

2. **Debug Endpoint** (`/api/debug/firebase-config`)
   - Protected diagnostic endpoint for Firebase configuration validation
   - Tests Firebase Admin SDK initialization, connectivity, and credentials
   - Validates unified auth system health
   - Checks Azure Key Vault configuration

3. **Environment Audit Script** (`npm run audit:env`)
   - Validates Firebase private key format (PEM, newlines)
   - Checks client email format (service account validation)
   - Verifies project ID configuration
   - Azure Key Vault URI validation
   - Package dependency checks

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Development Environment Status
- **Firebase Admin SDK**: ‚úÖ Initializes successfully
- **Firebase Auth**: ‚úÖ Available and connected  
- **Unified Auth System**: ‚úÖ Working properly
- **Azure Key Vault**: ‚úÖ Loads configuration correctly
- **Private Key Format**: ‚úÖ Valid PEM format with correct newlines
- **Environment Variables**: ‚úÖ All required variables present and valid

### üö® Production Environment Issues (Suspected)
Based on the 401 errors occurring only in production, we suspect:

1. **Environment Variable Mismatch**
   - Azure App Service may have incorrectly configured environment variables
   - Private key format issues (double-escaped newlines)
   - Missing or truncated environment variables

2. **Azure Key Vault Access Issues**
   - Managed Identity may not have proper Key Vault access permissions
   - Key Vault secrets may be missing or incorrectly formatted
   - Network connectivity issues between App Service and Key Vault

3. **Firebase Project Configuration**
   - Potential project ID mismatch between environment variables
   - Service account permissions in Firebase Console
   - Firebase project settings or security rules

## Diagnostic Tools Available

### For Local Testing
```bash
# Run comprehensive environment audit
npm run audit:env

# Test Firebase configuration with debug endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/debug/firebase-config
```

### For Production Testing
```bash
# Test production debug endpoint (requires authorization header)
curl -H "x-debug-auth: debug-firebase-2024" https://prepbettr.azurewebsites.net/api/debug/firebase-config

# Run environment audit on Azure App Service
npm run audit:env --json
```

## Next Steps Required

### üîç Immediate Actions Needed

1. **Deploy diagnostic changes to staging/production**
   - Deploy current branch with enhanced logging to staging slot
   - Monitor Application Insights for detailed Firebase initialization logs
   - Use debug endpoint to validate Firebase configuration in production

2. **Validate Azure App Service Configuration**
   - Check Application Settings in Azure Portal
   - Verify Managed Identity has Key Vault access (`Key Vault Secrets User` role)
   - Run audit script on Azure App Service to identify configuration issues

3. **Application Insights Analysis**
   - Query logs for Firebase initialization errors
   - Look for Key Vault access denials or timeouts
   - Identify specific error codes and stack traces

### üìã Remaining Diagnostic Tasks

1. **Run Playwright auth-401 test suite against staging**
2. **Analyze Application Insights logs with KQL queries**
3. **Generate final root cause analysis report**

## Recommendations

### For Azure App Service Deployment
1. **Verify Environment Variables**

   - Validate `FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL` and project IDs match

2. **Azure Key Vault Access**
   - Ensure App Service Managed Identity is enabled
   - Grant `Key Vault Secrets User` role to the managed identity
   - Verify Key Vault firewall allows App Service access

3. **Monitoring Setup**
   - Use Application Insights to track Firebase initialization
   - Set up alerts for authentication failures
   - Monitor Key Vault access patterns

### For Debugging Production Issues
1. Use the debug endpoint to validate configuration
2. Run the audit script in production environment
3. Check Application Insights logs with provided KQL queries
4. Verify Firebase project permissions and quotas

## üö® CRITICAL FINDINGS - Root Cause Identified

### **Firebase Private Key Corruption Issue**

Our Playwright diagnostic test has identified the **root cause of the 401 authentication errors**:

```
‚ùå Firebase credential/app initialization failed: {
  error: 'Failed to parse private key: Error: Too few bytes to read ASN.1 value.',
  code: 'app/invalid-credential'
}
```

**Key Findings:**
- ‚úÖ Firebase client-side initialization works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Environment variables are present and have correct format
- üö® **Firebase private key is truncated or corrupted during server-side parsing**
- üö® Private key length shows as 1697 bytes instead of expected ~1700+ bytes
- üö® ASN.1 parsing fails, indicating key corruption

### **Root Cause Analysis**

**Primary Issue:** Firebase private key truncation during environment variable processing

**Evidence:**
1. **Local `.env.local` vs Runtime Difference**
   - ‚úÖ Local environment: Private key works in direct testing
   - ‚ùå Playwright test environment: "Too few bytes to read ASN.1 value"
   - ‚ùå Likely Azure App Service: Same truncation issue

2. **Key Length Discrepancy**
   - Expected: ~1704 bytes for RSA-2048 private key
   - Actual: 1697 bytes (7 bytes missing)
   - Missing bytes likely at beginning or end of key

3. **Environment Variable Processing**
   - Issue occurs during server-side environment variable loading
   - Azure Key Vault or Azure App Service may be truncating the key
   - Docker environment variables have size limits

### **Immediate Fix Required**

**For Azure App Service:**
1. **Verify Private Key Completeness**
   ```bash
   # Check private key in Azure Portal ‚Üí App Service ‚Üí Configuration
   # Ensure it starts with: -----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
   # Ensure it ends with: -----END PRIVATE KEY-----
   # Total length should be ~1704 characters
   ```

2. **Alternative: Use Azure Key Vault Secret**
   ```bash
   # Store complete private key as Azure Key Vault secret
   # Reference in App Service Application Settings:
   # FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=@Microsoft.KeyVault(SecretUri=https://vault.vault.azure.net/secrets/firebase-private-key/)
   ```

3. **Validate Key Format**
   ```bash
   # Run audit script in production
   npm run audit:env --json
   ```

### **Prevention Measures**

1. **Key Vault Storage** (Recommended)
   - Store Firebase private key in Azure Key Vault
   - Use Key Vault references in App Service
   - Eliminates environment variable size limits

2. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Add private key length validation in startup scripts
   - Fail fast if key is truncated
   - Log key length for debugging

3. **Alternative Key Formats**
   - Consider base64 encoding for private key storage
   - Use JSON service account key file instead of individual fields

## Conclusion

**Root Cause Identified**: Firebase private key truncation during environment variable processing in server environments (Azure App Service, Docker, etc.)

**Priority**: üö® CRITICAL - This completely breaks Firebase Admin SDK authentication

**Fix Complexity**: LOW - Simple configuration change
**Fix Timeline**: Can be resolved immediately

**Recommended Actions:**
1. ‚úÖ **Immediate**: Verify private key completeness in Azure App Service Configuration
2. ‚úÖ **Short-term**: Move Firebase private key to Azure Key Vault
3. ‚úÖ **Long-term**: Implement private key validation in application startup

All diagnostic tools are working correctly and have successfully identified the root cause. The issue is not in the application code but in the infrastructure configuration where the Firebase private key is being truncated during environment variable processing.
