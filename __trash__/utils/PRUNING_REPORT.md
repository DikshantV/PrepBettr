# Step 6: Utility, Hook and Context Pruning Report

## Summary
Successfully completed pruning of unused code from `lib/`, `hooks/`, and `contexts/` directories using `ts-prune` and `ripgrep` verification.

## Actions Taken

### 1. Used `npx ts-prune` to identify unused exports
- Analyzed all exports in lib/, hooks/, and contexts/ directories
- Identified 20+ potentially unused functions and components

### 2. Confirmed with global ripgrep searches
- Verified each unused export with comprehensive text searches
- Excluded items referenced via string keys (Firebase functions, license services)

### 3. Moved unused code to `__trash__/utils/`

#### Files/Functions Moved:

**From `lib/utils.ts`:**
- `hasTechIcon()` - unused tech icon utility
- `getAvailableTechnologies()` - unused tech filtering
- `getTechLogos()` - legacy function
→ Moved to `unused-tech-utils.ts`

**From `lib/actions/general.action.ts`:**
- `getInterviewById()` - unused interview retrieval
- `getLatestInterviews()` - unused interview listing
- `getInterviewsByUserId()` - unused user interview lookup
→ Moved to `unused-general-actions.ts`

**From `contexts/LoadingContext.tsx`:**
- `LoadingProvider` component - unused loading context provider
- `useLoading()` hook - unused loading context hook
→ Moved to `unused-loading-context.tsx`

**From `hooks/`:**
- `usePageLoadComplete.tsx` - entire unused hook file
→ Moved to `__trash__/utils/`

**From `lib/hooks/`:**
- `useFirestore.ts` - unused Firestore hooks
- `useIsClient.ts` - duplicate client-side hook
→ Moved to `__trash__/utils/`

**From `lib/middleware/quota-middleware.ts`:**
- `withQuotaAndCache()` - unused cached quota wrapper
→ Moved to `unused-quota-middleware.ts`

**From `lib/services/cloud-functions-verification.ts`:**
- `CLOUD_FUNCTION_VERIFY_TOKEN` - unused Cloud Function template
→ Moved to `unused-cloud-functions-verification.ts`

**From `lib/services/firebase-verification.ts`:**
- `verifyFirebaseToken()` - unused helper function
- `createFirebaseSessionCookie()` - unused helper function
- `verifyFirebaseSessionCookie()` - unused helper function
→ Moved to `unused-firebase-verification.ts`

**From `lib/utils/`:**
- `jwt-decoder.ts` - entire unused utility file
- `parseResume.ts` - entire unused utility file
→ Moved to `__trash__/utils/`

## Code Preserved (Referenced via String Keys)

The following services were preserved as they are referenced via string keys in the Dodo Payments License Key system or Firebase function names:

- `EmailVerificationService` - used in email verification flow
- `LicenseKeyService` - used in license validation
- `MockLicenseKeyService` - used in development/testing
- `SubscriptionService` - used in subscription management
- `EmailLicenseTestUtils` - used in test utilities

## Results

**Before pruning:** 20+ unused exports identified by ts-prune
**After pruning:** Only services with string-key references remain in unused list
**Files moved:** 13 files/functions moved to `__trash__/utils/`
**Space saved:** Removed unused code from active codebase while preserving in trash for potential recovery

## Verification

Ran `npx ts-prune | grep -E "^(lib/|hooks/|contexts/)"` after cleanup:
- All moved functions no longer appear as unused
- Remaining items are marked as "(used in module)" or are legitimately used via string references
- Codebase is now cleaner with only actively used exports

## Next Steps

The pruned code has been safely moved to `__trash__/utils/` and can be:
1. Permanently deleted if confirmed unused
2. Restored if needed in the future
3. Used as reference for similar functionality
