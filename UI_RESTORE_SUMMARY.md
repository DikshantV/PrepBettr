## Marketing Page Files That Differ From Main

### app/marketing/ directory:
- **page.tsx** - Main marketing page with different hero text styling, different MacbookScroll image source, and different heading styling

## Key Authentication & Layout Files That Differ

- **app/layout.tsx** - Removed Providers wrapper component
- **components/authenticated-layout.tsx** - Major simplification from complex sidebar with collapsible sections, search, and dropdown menus to simpler flat navigation structure
- **app/(auth)/layout.tsx** - Listed in diff but needs verification

## Summary of Changes

The main differences appear to be:

1. **Authentication & UI fixes** - The main branch contains more recent authentication and UI improvements
2. **Premium Badge Integration** - Main branch has PremiumBadge components integrated into dashboard pages
3. **Layout Simplification** - The ui-restore branch has a simpler sidebar layout compared to the more complex collapsible structure in main
4. **Provider Structure** - Main branch uses a Providers wrapper component that's absent in ui-restore
5. **Marketing Page Updates** - Different styling and image sources for the marketing page

This commit (da82230) represents the state before the recent authentication and UI fixes, making it a good candidate for the "last known good" version mentioned in the task.
