## Technical Implementation

### CSS Classes Used

**Container Styling:**
```css
.container {
  @apply bg-gray-950 min-h-screen;
}

.card {
  @apply bg-gray-900 border border-gray-700 rounded-lg;
}
```

**Form Elements:**
```css
.input {
  @apply bg-gray-800 border-gray-600 text-white placeholder-gray-400;
  @apply focus:border-blue-500 focus-visible:ring-blue-500;
}

.button-primary {
  @apply bg-blue-600 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white border-blue-500;
}
```

### Accessibility Considerations

- **Contrast Ratios**: All text meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- **Focus Indicators**: Clear focus rings on all interactive elements
- **Color Independence**: Information not conveyed through color alone
- **Keyboard Navigation**: All interactive elements remain accessible

## File Structure

```
components/
├── ProfileForm.tsx          # Updated with dark theme
├── ResumeTailor.tsx        # Refactored for consistency
└── ui/
    └── tabs.tsx            # Compatible with dark theme

app/dashboard/
├── profile/page.tsx        # Updated page styling
├── resume-tailor/page.tsx  # Already had dark styling
└── settings/page.tsx       # Completely refactored
```

## Future Maintenance

### Adding New Components
When adding new components to these sections:

1. Use the established color palette
2. Follow the container → card → input hierarchy
3. Ensure proper contrast ratios
4. Test with keyboard navigation
5. Maintain consistency with existing interactive elements

### Updating Existing Elements
- Always test changes across all three sections
- Maintain the established visual hierarchy
- Ensure accessibility standards are preserved
- Consider the user experience flow between sections

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Visual Consistency**: Compare all sections to ensure uniform appearance
2. **Accessibility Testing**: Verify contrast ratios and keyboard navigation
3. **Responsive Design**: Test on different screen sizes
4. **User Flow**: Ensure smooth transitions between sections
5. **Dark Theme Compatibility**: Verify no light theme artifacts remain

## Conclusion

This refactor successfully creates a cohesive dark theme experience across the Resume Tailor, My Profile, and Settings sections. The implementation follows established design patterns, maintains accessibility standards, and provides a professional, modern interface that enhances the overall user experience of the PrepBettr application.

The consistent styling now ensures users have a seamless experience when navigating between different features, reinforcing the application's professional brand identity while maintaining excellent usability and accessibility standards.
