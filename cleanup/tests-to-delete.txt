# Testing Assets and CI/CD Cleanup Analysis

## Test Files Analysis
- Total test files found: 36
- Jest configuration appears functional
- Test structure seems organized and maintained

## GitHub Workflows Analysis (Keep All)
The GitHub workflows found are all production-critical:

### Production Deployment & CI/CD (KEEP)
- ci-comprehensive.yml - Main CI/CD pipeline
- production-deployment.yml - Production deployment automation  
- azure-app-service-deploy.yml - Azure App Service deployment
- azure-optimization-deployment.yml - Azure resource optimization
- azure-static-web-apps-jolly-cliff-0244e530f.yml - Static web app deployment

### Configuration Management (KEEP)  
- config-apply-changes.yml - Configuration change automation
- config-change-proposal.yml - Configuration proposal workflow
- config-rollback.yml - Configuration rollback procedures

### Testing Workflows (KEEP)
- hydration-tests.yml - Next.js hydration testing

## Test Fixtures and Mocks (Review Required)
Located in:
- tests/mocks/ - Contains MSW handlers and server setup (KEEP - actively used)
- tests/setup/ - Contains test setup and performance baselines (KEEP - actively used)
- tests/utils/ - Contains test utilities and fixtures (KEEP - actively used)

## Test Reports and Coverage (Safe to Delete)
The following directories can be cleaned up:
- ./test-reports/ - Old test report artifacts
- ./coverage/ - Coverage reports (regenerated on each run)
- ./playwright-report/ - Playwright HTML reports (regenerated)
- ./test-results/ - Playwright test results (regenerated)

## Legacy Test Files (Review Individual Files)
Files to review for potential removal:
- test-voice-interview.js (root level) - Legacy test file, check if superseded
- test_responsive_verification.js (root level) - Legacy responsive test
- lighthouse-audit.js (root level) - Performance audit script
- Any unused test configuration files

## Test Dependencies Analysis
Based on deps analysis:
- @testing-library/react-hooks - REMOVE (unused)
- @firebase/rules-unit-testing - REMOVE (unused) 
- supertest - REMOVE (unused in current test suite)
- @types/jest - REMOVE (using @jest/globals instead)

Keep:
- jest-environment-jsdom - Used for client-side component tests
- jest-environment-node - Used for server-side tests
- @playwright/test - Used for E2E tests
- msw - Used for API mocking

## CI/CD Recommendations
1. Keep ALL GitHub workflows - they are production-critical
2. Clean up test report directories (regenerated on each run)
3. Remove legacy test files at root level
4. Update test dependencies as identified in deps analysis

## Files Safe to Delete
- ./test-reports/ (entire directory)  
- ./coverage/ (coverage reports - regenerated)
- ./playwright-report/ (HTML reports - regenerated)
- ./test-results/ (test results - regenerated)
- test-voice-interview.js (root level legacy file)
- test_responsive_verification.js (root level legacy file)
- Any .tsbuildinfo files in test directories

## Files to Keep
- All files in tests/ directory structure
- All GitHub workflow files (.github/workflows/*)
- jest.config.ts and related config files
- playwright.config.ts files
- All test setup and utility files
