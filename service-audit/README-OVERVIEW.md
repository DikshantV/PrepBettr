# Firebase & Azure Service Dependency Analysis
## PrepBettr Application Service Inventory & Risk Assessment

**Analysis Date:** August 21, 2024  
**Codebase Version:** Current working directory  
**Analysis Scope:** Complete Firebase and Azure service dependencies

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This comprehensive analysis identifies and evaluates all Firebase and Azure service dependencies across the PrepBettr codebase. Key findings include:

### üî¢ Service Usage Statistics
- **169 files** with Firebase dependencies (**65 unique imports**, **1,571 service calls**)
- **121 files** with Azure dependencies (**85 unique imports**, **801 service calls**)
- **High overlap** in authentication and storage functionality
- **Critical paths** through voice interviews, authentication, and data storage

### üö® Key Risk Areas
1. **gRPC/SSL compatibility issues** with Firebase Admin SDK requiring REST API fallbacks
2. **Dual authentication systems** creating complexity and potential conflicts  
3. **Azure Key Vault as single point of failure** for configuration management
4. **Storage service duplication** between Firebase Storage and Azure Blob Storage

## üéØ Key Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (0-30 days)
- [ ] Address gRPC SSL issues with Firebase Admin SDK
- [ ] Implement unified authentication service abstraction
- [ ] Add Azure Key Vault fallback monitoring

### Strategic Improvements (1-6 months)  
- [ ] Consolidate storage services into unified interface
- [ ] Migrate critical Firebase dependencies to stable alternatives
- [ ] Implement service health monitoring and alerting

### Long-term Considerations (6+ months)
- [ ] Evaluate vendor lock-in reduction strategies
- [ ] Consider serverless architecture simplification
- [ ] Plan for service deprecation lifecycle management

## üìä Analysis Methodology

### Automated Scanning
1. **Keyword-based source code scanning** using ripgrep for Firebase/Azure identifiers
2. **Structured parsing** of scan results into JSON format with imports and service calls
3. **Dependency mapping** using Graphviz for visual representation

### Manual Code Review
1. **Critical service file analysis** focusing on authentication and storage patterns
2. **Shared functionality identification** for consolidation opportunities  
3. **Risk assessment** based on usage patterns, criticality, and failure impact

### Quality Assurance
- **Spot-checking** of service calls against scan results
- **Cross-reference validation** between reports and source code
- **Markdown formatting and link validation**

## üìû Support & Next Steps

This analysis provides the foundation for:
1. **Service consolidation planning**
2. **Risk mitigation strategy development**  
3. **Technical debt reduction roadmap**
4. **Vendor dependency evaluation**

**Recommended follow-up:** Review findings with architecture team and prioritize implementation of unified service abstractions.
